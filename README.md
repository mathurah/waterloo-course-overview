# Waterloo Journey üìö

A website containing my thoughts on the courses I've taken so far and any notes! Thought this would be a nice way to have something to look back on at the end of university, and a resource for any students considering SYDE to see what the courses are like. 

Unfortunately, I didn't start documneting much until 2A, so content is still in progress! 

## How it was built ‚öíÔ∏è
- Using Gatsby and `gatsby transformer remark`, `gatsby-source-filesystem` to process all of the markdown files

## Special Credits
- Goose stamp was created by [Krystal Truong](https://github.com/krystaltruong)
- [Chamod Gamage](https://github.com/chamod-gamage) for the help + feedback and random cat gifs left on the website 

**Inspirations for this website**
- https://mit.katmh.com/: I came across her website and that's what inspired me to start documenting what I've learned from my courses!
- https://notebook.lachlanjc.com: Huge fan of the design of this website
