### Report for SYDE 261, by Abigail Waterston, Aidan Bowers, Silja Walenius, Mathurah Ravigulan, Joy He

## Introduction

Homesharing is the social practice where residents of a living space (hosts) will share their living facilities with others (guests), typically at a nightly or monthly cost. In recent years, a number of technologies have been developed to make homesharing easier for both guests and hosts. This rise in homesharing comes with the rise of the “sharing economy” in general, which refers to the increase in popularity of using and sharing spaces, services, and items amongst others, rather than individual ownership [1]. Other notable areas of the sharing economy include ridesharing (eg. Uber, Lyft) and workspace sharing (eg. WeWork, Center for Social Innovation).

Web platforms such as Couchsurfing.com and Home Exchange allow users to connect and share their spaces for no cost. Couchsurfing lets users browse lodgings listed on the site, and connect with their owners. Couchsurfing stays are typically in the range of a few nights, with the focus being on a genuine cultural experience and interpersonal connection rather than a particularly attractive location or private residence [2]. Home Exchange allows users of the site to list their residences as potential rentals, and then browse the site for other residences in different countries or areas of the world. Unlike other homesharing platforms, Home Exchange only allows listing of entire houses or apartments. Users can then connect with other home owners, and “trade” residences for a specified period of time, usually within the range of a few weeks. Neither of these platforms allow their users to profit off of sharing their space.

Other platforms such as VRBO (previously Homeaway) and Airbnb are generally advertised as paid short-term rentals. These services allow guests to book a room or entire residence for varying periods of time at a set price. Short-term rentals are typically used by tourists and travelers looking for affordable or specialized accommodations for the duration of a vacation or other event, but have also allowed for societal groups like “digital nomads” [3] to travel and reside in foreign countries for extended periods of time.

Homesharing lodgings have become increasingly popular in recent years as alternatives to traditional hotel accommodation. The homesharing sector is expected to continue to grow, predicted to reach USD 107 billion, or 10% of total accommodation bookings, in the US alone by 2025 [4]. As these platforms continue to gain increased adoption, their environmental and social impacts will be amplified.

## Summary of Impacts

The primary users of homesharing technologies are the owner of the homes and the guests staying in these homes. Homesharing technologies have made accommodations more affordable, increasing the ability of individuals to travel [5]. With the abundance of listings on homesharing platforms, however, the lack of regulation, hygienic procedures and the rise of COVID have caused “70% of guests [to be] fearful to stay at an Airbnb” [6]. For hosts, homesharing technologies provide a source of supplemental income.

Homesharing platforms are often used as an alternative to hotels, and their widespread adoption has had a significant negative impact on hotel average revenue and occupancy rates [7]. Given that hosts typically hire fewer people at lower wages than hotels, reductions in hotel performance could translate to the loss of real and potential jobs and wages in this sector [8].

Airbnb and other similar homesharing platforms have significant impacts on the local societies where listings are found, specifically by inflating the cost of rent. In Boston it was found that increases in Airbnb listings are correlated with a decrease in available rental units, and resulted in a citywide mean monthly rent increase of $93 [9]. There is also evidence to suggest that, as housing units are converted from long- to short-term rentals, communities turn into tourist areas that clash with the established residents of the community, resulting in a lower quality of life [10]. The prevalence of Airbnb in a neighbourhood is also correlated to long-term increases in property crime, further impacting the quality of life of local residents [11].

Globally, homesharing technologies are poorly regulated in terms of tax policy [12]. Airbnb properties are typically not required to pay lodging tax and, in 2016, this lack of tax collection by Airbnb led to an estimated $110 million dollars of tax revenue lost in New York City [12]. In the same year, Airbnb guests in New York City only spent a combined total of $10 million on tourism [12]. In the long-term, this may lead to reduced services and public programming for residents. Platforms like Couchsurfing have a smaller effect on overall government tax revenue, as they don’t allow the host to earn any income [2].

Hotels can have a massive negative impact on the local environment at construction, such as through land-clearing [13]. Because homesharing platforms make use of existing development, the environmental impact is minimized during the material acquisition to production phases. During the use phase, hotels generally expend more energy and resources per guest than residential housing because of energy-intensive amenities [14]. Additionally, hotels require the continual replacement of furniture and decor every few years, along with larger renovations every 15-20 years, and generally only have a lifespan of 20-60 years [15]. In comparison, homesharing units consume 63% less energy, and consume and dispose of fewer material resources than traditional hotel accommodation [16].

Because home-sharing platforms are often more affordable than traditional vacation accommodations, they enable travellers to travel more often and further away [17]. At least 75% of emissions due to tourism are due to transportation, so by increasing travel rates, homesharing platforms may increase emissions during the transportation phase [18].

## Social Impact and Defensible Recommendation

It is often more lucrative for landlords to rent out units to short-term guests on homesharing platforms than to long-term tenants [8]. This incentivizes owners to convert their properties to short-term vacation rentals, thereby reducing the supply of long-term rentals on the market. In Toronto, for example, an estimated 6500 units have been pulled from the long-term rental market and converted to homesharing units [19]. This reduced supply of long-term rentals should, by economic principles, drive up rent prices, impairing access to housing for locals.

The effect of homesharing platforms on housing prices has been realized in several large US cities. In Los Angeles, New York City, and Boston, studies have found that the presence of Airbnb listings in a neighbourhood has significantly increased rent prices [8, 20, 9]. In New York City, for example, Airbnb’s influence cost New Yorkers approximately $616 million in additional rent in 2016 [20]. These effects on rents disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of colour, leading to displacement of long-time residents and demographic shifts [10, 21]. In neighbourhoods across North America, homesharing platforms are decreasing the supply of long-term housing, thereby increasing housing prices.

On the flip side, homesharing can offer an additional income source to put towards rent or mortgage, thereby making housing more affordable for hosts. Homeowners with an Airbnb listing “may gain almost a fifth of their median monthly rental or mortgage costs'' [22]. In a survey of hosts, over half responded that they would not be able to afford their home without the income from Airbnb [23]. The importance of homesharing as an income source for hosts has been demonstrated during the Covid-19 pandemic when 41% of hosts had to seek out and take on alternative revenue streams after tourism and stays plummeted [19].

Though homesharing platforms advertise themselves as providing supplemental income to everyday homeowners, evidence shows that the majority of income generated through these platforms actually goes to rental agencies, not individual homeowners. While these platforms promote images of shared spaces between hosts and guests, in Los Angeles, AirBnB earns 89% of its revenue from companies and lessors of an entire unit, as opposed to individual homeowners [8]. This is particularly striking when on-site hosts make up 52% of all hosts on the platform, but make 11% of the revenue [8]. It is clear, then, that the presence of homesharing platforms mostly benefits companies and those with the means to afford multiple properties, to the detriment of residents looking for long-term affordable housing.

To protect the supply of affordable housing for long-term residents, homesharing platforms must be more tightly regulated. Specifically, hosts should be required to register their properties as vacation rentals. This strategy has proven to be effective in Paris and San Francisco, where it led to a decrease in the number of homesharing listings and a number of landlords converting their properties back to long-term rentals [24]. Registering homesharing properties helps to reduce the incentive for landowners to remove units from the long-term rental market, preserving supply and affordable rental prices.

## Environmental Impact and Defensible Recommendation

The tourism sector, including transportation, accommodation, and activities, accounts for approximately 5% of global carbon emissions [18]. As homesharing platforms become increasingly popular as tourist accommodations, they will have a significant influence on travel patterns and frequency, as well as the associated environmental impacts [17].

Homesharing options are generally less expensive per night than traditional vacation accommodations [25]. Airbnb, for example, can offer savings of up to 49% to book a private room as opposed to a hotel [26], while other platforms such as Home Exchange and Couchsurfing are completely free [27, 28]. By making travel more affordable, homesharing platforms may increase the frequency of travel and the associated negative impacts, such as transportation-related carbon emissions. Additionally, the money saved by using homesharing platforms has been associated with increased consumption while on vacation [4]. As predicted by the efficiency paradox, savings in one area translate to increased consumption in other areas, so the net impact on the environment is neutral or negative.

Though homesharing rentals have the potential to increase tourism and related environmental impacts, their current impact seems to be minimal, with only 2-4% of users saying that they would not have travelled if homesharing were not an option [12]. Additionally, compared to hotels, homesharing rentals actually have a lower environmental impact. According to Airbnb, homesharing rentals consume 63% less energy, produce 61% less greenhouse gas emissions, and lead to 32% increased waste avoidance as compared to hotels [16]. Homesharing platforms enable sustainable lodging, making use of excess capacity to provide more energy-efficient accommodation options [29].

It should be noted that the above study showing the environmental advantages of homesharing rentals was paid for by Airbnb, and the data, assumptions, and methodologies are not publicly available [30]. This is not uncommon, as homesharing platforms are not generally open with their data, making it difficult to independently study the effect of these platforms on tourism and the environment [25]. While Airbnb has argued that the increase in transportation-related carbon emissions is more than offset by the energy-efficiency of Airbnb rentals [30], given that transport accounts for 75% of carbon emissions from tourism, it seems unlikely that energy-efficient rentals could completely offset increased transportation [18].

It is evident that more and better data is needed to understand the effect of homesharing on tourism and associated environmental harm. While homesharing platforms such as Airbnb and Vrbo have made their data increasingly open to the public, there still exist gaps in knowledge that prevent a full understanding of how homesharing platforms affect the areas they operate in [31]. Governments should continue to direct homesharing platforms to release their data, specifically regarding environmental effects and tourism patterns, to promote sustainable tourism and limit its impact on the environment.
