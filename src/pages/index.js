     <h3>ðŸ‘‹ hey there!</h3>
        <p>This blog is a chance for me to look back on all my courses after the degree for memories on what I've learned and my experiences with them!</p>
        <p>I also thought it would be a good reference for any future SYDEs or those considering Systems Design Engineering to get a better idea of what the courses are like, and hopefully answer the question: What the heck even is Systems Design Engineering? (although I'm still wondering the answer to that question myself).</p>
        <p>These are the opinions of just one student and I'd encourage you to reach out to other people in Systems Design Engineering to share their experiences!</p>
